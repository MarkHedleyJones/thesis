\part{Double Layers On Insulators}

    \label{part:doubleLayersOnInsulators}
        
    Part \ref{part:doubleLayersOnInsulators} deals with double layers formed on electrical insulators.
    Two examples of where this happens are the walls of plastic or glass containers.
    
    A practical application of double layers on insulators is to the field of energy harvesting.
    It was discussed in the introduction that double layers naturally form at liquid-solid interfaces.
    It was said that the double layer itself is a collection of charged ions.
    Can we collect this charge and convert it into electrical energy?

    In this part I explain how to harvest energy from water and glass without moving parts.
    I look at a smart application of a water such a harvester, create a power budget, and discuss the design of a practical harvester.

    \chapter{Harvesting Energy}
        \label{chap:harvestingEnergy}

        This chapter demonstrates an energy harvesting device capable of harvesting energy from flowing water with no moving parts.
        A `smart' use for such a harvester is discussed in chapter \ref{chap:wirelessWaterMetering}.
        I find the minimum power a harvester needs to harvest in order to be useful in chapter \ref{chap:energyRequirements}.
        And finally, in chapter \ref{chap:harvesterDesign}, I discuss the design of a harvester and comment on its feasibility.

    \chapter{Wireless Water Metering}
        \label{chap:wirelessWaterMetering}

        A method of power harvesting was put forward in chapter \ref{chap:harvestingEnergy} that used water flow as a source of energy.
        We expect the lack moving parts in that design will reduce or eliminate maintenance costs.
        Such a low maintenance harvester is ideal for water utility companies to measure and record water usage.
        This chapter discusses how such a water meter might be implemented.
        The content in this chapter is used as the basis for investigating the energy requirements of such a harvester.
