\chapter*{Abstract}
  Double layers pop-up where liquids meet solids or other dissimilar liquids.
  Their presence is unnoticed at the macroscopic level as they are too small to feel or see.
  They are responsible for stabilising some of our most important fluids -- blood, milk, paints, and inks.
  These mixtures would clump and loose their fluidity without double layers.

  Firstly, we try to leverage double layer behaviour to harvest energy.
  We look at the practicality of using energy harvesting cells that utilise double layers as a means of converting fluid energy into electrical energy.
  The primary application of such a harvester would be to power electronic water meters.
  Domestic water meters are typically installed where electrical connection is not feasible; harvesting energy here makes electronic metering practical.
  I show why such a harvester cannot yet be used to harvest the quantity of energy required in Part~\ref{part:doubleLayersOnInsulators}.

  In Part~\ref{part:doubleLayersOnConductors}, we look at how the double layer contributes to the electrical impedance of submerged electrodes.
  This work is especially important to designers of medical implants where such electrodes are used in-vivo.
  Typically they use solutions of saline to replicate the impedance of a living person.
  For example, diluted solutions of saline are used to mimic the human spinal cavity.
  I quantify the response of medical electrodes submerged in a range of saline solutions.
  I show you that saline is not a good representation of a spinal canal by measuring and comparing the response inside a living animal!
  Finally, I present recipes for solutions that better biological tissue.
