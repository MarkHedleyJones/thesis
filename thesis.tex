\chapter*{Abstract}
  When solids and liquids are brought together, interfacial double-layers are likely to form.
  They are too small to feel or see so their presence goes mostly unnoticed at the macroscopic level.
  A double layer is essentially a cluster of ions and/or charged molecules which are drawn from the body of a liquid to the surface of a solid.
  They are responsible for stabilising some of our most important fluids -- blood, milk, paints, and inks.
  Without the protection of double-layers, these mixtures clump and lose their fluidity.

  Interfacial double-layers represent the underlying theme of this work, which is broken into two parts.
  In~\cref{part:doubleLayersOnInsulators}, double layers are used as a means of converting fluid-mechanical energy into electrical energy; the primary application being an energy harvester that could power electronic water meters.
  Domestic water meters are typically installed where electrical connection is not feasible.
  Harvesting energy at the meter may make electronic metering a feasible long-term solution.
  My findings show that double layer based energy harvesters are not efficient enough for this application \emph{yet}.
  However, recent literature on the subject suggests large gains in efficiency may be possible using more exotic materials.
  Such gains would allow a compact harvester to generate enough energy to operate an electronic meter with wireless transmitter.

  \Cref{part:doubleLayersOnConductors} models the electrical impedance of electrodes submerged in electrolytes.
  Double-layers contribute to the electrical impedance between solid-fluid interfaces.
  This work is important to designers of medical implants; and by extension, anybody who relies on the implants themselves.
  Engineers use solutions of saline to mimic the environment experienced by their implants once implanted.
  This provides a way to test implant electronics without putting a patient at risk.
  A way of characterising the interface between electrodes and an electrolyte is to model it mathematically.
  An electrical model of an electrode-electrolyte interface was recently developed by my supervisor, Jonathan Scott.
  I use that model to compare electrodes placed in solutions of saline to those placed in a living animal.
  Measurements of the two show that no one concentration of saline matches the situation inside a live spinal cavity.
  I then create a low-cost electrolyte test solution that better matches the impedance measured in a living animal's spinal cavity.

%% Part 1 - Energy Harvesting

\part{Double Layers on Insulators: Harvesting Energy}
   \label{part:doubleLayersOnInsulators}

   In \cref{sect:background_doubleLayers}, the topic of interfacial double layers were introduced.
   Then, in \cref{sect:background_streamingCells}, a way of utilising double layers to harvest energy - in a process called streaming - was studied.
   The possibility of using streaming cells as a means of powering electronic water meters is investigated.
   The following chapter (\cref{chap:part1_streamingCellHarvesters}) presents a brief mathematical analysis before a batch of cells are fabricated and measured.
   Measurements from those cells are used to determine their efficiency.
   Then in \cref{chap:part1_waterMetering} the applicability of streaming cells for use in water metering is discussed.
   This presents an estimation of water use in a typical New Zealand home that will be used to determine the amount of energy available to a harvester.
   \Cref{chap:part1_energyHarvestingRequirements} measures the energy consumption of low-power, 8-bit microcontrollers and wireless transmitters.
   The measured data is used to estimate the energy requirements of an electronic water meter with wireless transmitter.
   Finally, in \cref{chap:part1_conclusion}, the feasibility of using streaming cells as energy harvesters for water meters based on the previous measurements is discussed and conclusions are drawn.

%% Part 3 - Double layers on conductors
\part{Double Layers on Conductors: Electrical Impedance}
  \label{part:doubleLayersOnConductors}

  For the engineers of medical implant devices, knowing the electrical impedance between electrodes is vital.
  Having a tool to simulate such impedances allows those designers to ensure fault free operation of potentially lethal devices.
  The most commonly used theoretical approach in electrochemical modelling is to construct an equivalent electrical circuit~\cite{Ishai2013}.
  An electrical model of the interface impedance between electrode and electrolyte is presented in the proceeding chapter.
  That model was developed by my chief supervisor Jonathan Scott and Peter Single of Saluda Medical, Sydney.
  Validation of the model was made in a standard solution of saline, but details of how saline concentration affected the parameters were unknown.
  In \cref{part:doubleLayersOnConductors} of thesis I take that model and extend its predictive capability to a range of salinities.
  Having such a model allows for easy comparison between different electrolytes and electrode geometries.
  Using that ability, I characterise the interface in an anaesthetised sheep's spinal cavity and compare the results to the various saline solutions measured in the lab.
  That comparison showed that the situation in live sheep is significantly different to that of standard saline solutions.
  Using the measurement methods developed, I then develop a mixture that closely matches the electrical impedance seen in sheep.
  This mixture now serves as an improved test solution for the engineers of medical implant devices.

  \chapter{Summary}
    \label{chap:part2_summary}
    An impedance model of a pair of electrodes in a solution of phosphate buffered saline has been taken and extended to cover a wider range of salinities.
    Relationships between that model's parameter values and saline concentration were determined and represented as equations.
    They showed that when varying the salinity, the impedance of the constant phase element scaled much slower than the series resistance.
    With those parameters extended to a range of salinities, the model proves to be a useful reference point for comparison to other solutions.
    Measurements of electrical current associated with Faradaic reactions showed that cyclic voltammetry measurements are poorly suited to capture Faradaic current.
    % Using a step measurement method clearly revealed the CPE's capacitance changing with applied current.
    % As the voltage and current is constantly changing during cyclic voltammetry, the CPE's capacitance is also changing and is therefore having an impact on those measurements.
    After moving to step based measurements, the collected data was consistent and matched the expected response of exponential growth.
    They revealed the dependence of capacitance on the current density at the electrode as proposed by Schwan~\cite{Schwan1968}.
    These measurements also revealed that at low voltages, below \SI{900}{\milli\volt} across a pair of electrodes, saline concentration has no measurable effect on the reaction rate.
    That observation should be especially important to implant engineers since they must avoid any Faradaic reactions in-vivo.
    Knowing that an electrolyte's salinity is not linked to the magnitude of those reactions at their onset simplifies that constraint.
    Those measurements also suggest that the interface is setting the ionic concentration at the surface, in a localised volume surrounding the electrode, in constant voltage situations.
    That volume of ions is likely to be the double layer itself, which is consumed by Faradaic reactions and replenished by ion migration from the electrolyte bulk.
    Once the layer has been consumed, the rate reaction rate of Faradaic reactions is determined by the saline concentration of the bulk solution.
    This hypothesis fits the data presented \cref{fig:graph_currentVoltage_logY_Thesis}.

    With the model fitted to solutions of phosphate buffered saline, a comparison is made to a living mammal.
    In-vivo measurements in live sheep spine show that no single concentration of phosphate buffered saline matches the impedance of both the CPE and series resistance.
    If a single concentration of buffered saline had to be used to match both the CPE and series resistance then the one-tenth concentration solution is a good trade-off, but is a poor match to both.
    The measurements also show that the spinal cavity provides a significant amount of reactance, which is not present in saline solutions.
    Modelling that reactance could be done by fitting inductive and/or capacitive elements to the resistive mesh of the model.
    That step was not taken due to the complexity of the geometry inside the spinal canal and variability expected between epidural insertions.

    Seeing that the match between saline and a sheep's spinal cavity were poor I then created a mixture that improved the match.
    Tests with a variety of ingredients showed that a mix of salt, cornflour and water improved the match dramatically.
    The impedance presented by the CPE moved with ratio of cornflour to water, whereas the series resistance was determined by the salt.
    It appears as though the cornflour, when in high enough concentrations, reduced the capacitive effect by displacing active species in the liquid with inert filler.
