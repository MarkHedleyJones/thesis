\chapter*{Abstract}
  When solids and liquids are brought together, interfacial double-layers are likely to form.
  They are too small to feel or see so their presence goes mostly unnoticed at the macroscopic level.
  Double layers stabilise some of our most important fluids -- blood, milk, paints, and inks.
  Without the protection of double-layers, these mixtures clump and lose their fluidity.

  Interfacial double-layers link the two halves of this thesis and form the underlying theme.
  In~\cref{part:doubleLayersOnInsulators}, double layers are used as a means of converting fluid-mechanical energy into electrical energy.
  The primary application being an energy harvester that could power electronic water meters.
  Domestic water meters are typically installed where electrical connection is not feasible.
  Harvesting energy at the meter may make electronic metering a feasible long-term solution.
  My findings show that double layer based energy harvesters are not efficient enough for this application \emph{yet}.
  Recent literature on the subject suggests large gains in efficiency may be possible using more exotic materials.
  Such gains would allow a compact harvester to generate enough energy to operate an electronic meter with wireless transmitter.

  \Cref{part:doubleLayersOnConductors} models the electrical impedance of electrodes submerged in an electrolyte.
  Double-layers contribute to the electrical impedance between solid-fluid interfaces.
  This work is important to designers of medical implants; and by extension, anybody who relies on the implants themselves.
  Engineers use solutions of saline to mimic the environment experienced by their implants once implanted.
  This provides a way to test implant electronics without putting a patient at risk.
  A way of characterising the interface between electrodes and an electrolyte is to model it mathematically.
  An electrical of an electrode-electrolyte interface was recently developed by my supervisor, Jonathan Scott.
  I use that model to compare electrodes placed in solutions of saline to those placed in a living animal.
  Measurements of the two show that no one concentration of saline matches the situation inside a live spinal cavity.
  I then create a low-cost electrolyte test solution that better matches the impedance measured in a living animal's spinal cavity.

%% Part 1 - Energy Harvesting

\part{Double Layers on Insulators: Harvesting Energy}
   \label{part:doubleLayersOnInsulators}

   In \cref{sect:background_doubleLayers}, the topic of interfacial double layers were introduced.
   Then, in \cref{sect:background_streamingCells}, a way of utilising double layers to harvest energy - in a process called streaming - was studied.
   The possibility of using streaming cells as a means of powering electronic water meters is now put to the test.
   \Cref{chap:part1_streamingCellHarvesters} studies streaming cells, where some test cells are made and measured.
   With an understanding of readily available streaming cell performance, their applicability for use in water metering is discussed in \cref{chap:part1_waterMetering}.
   This presents an estimation of water use in a typical New Zealand home which is used to determine the amount of energy available to a harvester.
   \Cref{chap:part1_energyHarvestingRequirements} measures the energy consumption of low-power, 8-bit microcontrollers and wireless transmitters.
   The measured data is used to estimate the energy requirements of an electronic water meter with wireless transmitter.
   Finally, in \cref{chap:part1_conclusion}, the feasibility of using streaming cells as energy harvesters for our intended application is discussed and the conclusion is made.

%% Part 3 - Double layers on conductors
\part{Double Layers on Conductors: Electrical Impedance}
  \label{part:doubleLayersOnConductors}

  For the engineers of medical implant devices, knowing the electrical impedance between electrodes is important.
  Having a tool to simulate such impedances allows those designers to ensure fault free operation of potentially lethal devices.
  A model of the interface impedance between electrode and electrolyte is presented in the proceeding chapter.
  That model was created by my chief supervisor Jonathan Scott and Peter Single of Saluda Medical Sydney.
  Validation of the model was made in a standard solution of saline, but details of how saline concentration affected the parameters were unknown.
  In \cref{part:doubleLayersOnConductors} of thesis thesis I take that model and extend its predictive capability to a range of salinities.
  Having such a model allows for easy comparison between different electrolytes and electrode geometries.
  Using that ability, I characterise the interface in an anaesthetised sheep's spinal cavity and compare the results to the various saline solutions measured in the lab.
  That comparison showed that the situation in live sheep is relatively different to that of standard saline solutions.
  Using the measurement methods developed, I then find a mixture that closely matches the electrical impedance seen in sheep.
  This mixture now serves as an improved test solution for the engineers of medical implant devices.
