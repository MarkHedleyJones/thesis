\chapter*{Abstract}
  When a solid comes in contact with a liquid, an interfacial double-layer is likely to form.
  They are too small to feel or see so their presence goes mostly unnoticed at the macroscopic level.
  Double layers stabilise some of our most important fluids -- blood, milk, paints, and inks.
  Without the protection of double-layers, these mixtures clump and lose their fluidity.

  This thesis is separated into two parts, both linked to the behaviour of double-layers.
  In~\cref{part:doubleLayersOnInsulators} these layers are used as a means of converting fluid-mechanical energy into electrical energy.
  The primary application of such a harvester would be to power electronic water meters.
  Domestic water meters are typically installed where electrical connection is not feasible; harvesting energy here may makes electronic metering more feasible long-term.
  My findings show that double layer based energy harvesters are not efficient enough for this application yet.
  Recent literature on the subject suggests large gains in efficiency may be possible using more exotic materials.

  \Cref{part:doubleLayersOnConductors} models the electrical impedance of submerged electrodes.
  Double-layers play a large part in determining the electrical impedance between metal-fluid interfaces.
  This work is important to designers of medical implants; and by extension, anybody who relies on the implants themselves.
  Engineers use solutions of saline to mimic the environment experienced by their implants once implanted.
  This gives them a way to test the implant without injuring anyone.
  A way of characterising the interface between electrodes in solution is to model it mathematically.
  Such a model was created by my supervisor, Jonathan Scott.
  I use that model to compare electrodes placed in solutions of saline to those placed in a living animal.
  Measurements of the two show they are quite different from one another.
  I create a mixture using low-cost ingredients that closely resembles the electrical impedance of a live animal.

%% Part 1 - Energy Harvesting

\part{Double Layers on Insulators: Harvesting Energy}
  \label{part:doubleLayersOnInsulators}
  In~\cref{chap:introduction_main}, basic principles of double layers were put forward.
  It is the electrical conductivity of the solid material that divides the two topics of this thesis.
  \Cref{part:doubleLayersOnInsulators} looks specifically at double layer formation between liquids and non-conductive solids, e.g., glass.
  Later, in~\cref{part:doubleLayersOnConductors}, conductive materials will be examined with a rather different application.

  The previous introduction shows that double layers are simply collections of charged ions.
  Can we collect these ions and use them to generate electrical power?
  Doing so would provide a method of energy harvesting without moving parts.
  \Cref{part:doubleLayersOnInsulators} explores energy harvesting applications of interfacial double layers.
  I build and measure a streaming cell harvester at test the idea of using it to run an electronic water meter.
  To see if such an application is feasible, I create a power budget of energy available, and energy required by the electronics.
  This work is wrapped up with a discussion of practicalities and final conclusions regarding feasibility and future work.
