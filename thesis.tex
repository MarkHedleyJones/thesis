\chapter*{Abstract}
  When a solid comes in contact with a liquid, an interfacial double-layer is likely to form.
  They are too small to feel or see so their presence goes mostly unnoticed at the macroscopic level.
  Double layers stabilise some of our most important fluids -- blood, milk, paints, and inks.
  Without the protection of double-layers, these mixtures clump and lose their fluidity.

  This thesis is separated into two parts, both linked to the behaviour of double-layers.
  In~\cref{part:doubleLayersOnInsulators} these layers are used as a means of converting fluid-mechanical energy into electrical energy.
  The primary application of such a harvester would be to power electronic water meters.
  Domestic water meters are typically installed where electrical connection is not feasible; harvesting energy here may makes electronic metering more feasible long-term.
  My findings show that double layer based energy harvesters are not efficient enough for this application yet.
  Recent literature on the subject suggests large gains in efficiency may be possible using more exotic materials.

  \Cref{part:doubleLayersOnConductors} models the electrical impedance of submerged electrodes.
  Double-layers play a large part in determining the electrical impedance between metal-fluid interfaces.
  This work is important to designers of medical implants; and by extension, anybody who relies on the implants themselves.
  Engineers use solutions of saline to mimic the environment experienced by their implants once implanted.
  This gives them a way to test the implant without injuring anyone.
  A way of characterising the interface between electrodes in solution is to model it mathematically.
  Such a model was created by my supervisor, Jonathan Scott.
  I use that model to compare electrodes placed in solutions of saline to those placed in a living animal.
  Measurements of the two show they are quite different from one another.
  I create a mixture using low-cost ingredients that closely resembles the electrical impedance of a live animal.

%% Part 1 - Energy Harvesting

\part{Double Layers on Insulators: Harvesting Energy}
  \label{part:doubleLayersOnInsulators}

  In~\cref{sect:background_doubleLayers}, the topic of interfacial double layers were introduced.
  Then, in~\cref{sect:background_streamingCells}, a way of utilising double layers to harvest energy - in a process called streaming - was studied.
  The possibility of using streaming cells as a means of powering electronic water meters is now put to the test.
  \Cref{chap:part1_streamingCellHarvesters} studies streaming cells, where some test cells are made and measured.
  With an understanding of readily available streaming cell performance, their applicability for use in water metering is discussed in~\cref{chap:part1_waterMetering}.
  This presents an estimation of water use in a typical New Zealand home which is used to determine the amount of energy available to a harvester.
  \Cref{chap:part1_energyHarvestingRequirements} measures the energy consumption of low-power, 8-bit microcontrollers and wireless transmitters.
  The measured data is used to estimate the energy requirements of an electronic water meter with wireless transmitter.
  Finally, in \cref{chap:part1_conclusion}, the feasibility of using streaming cells as energy harvesters for our intended application is discussed and the conclusion is made.
