\chapter*{Abstract}
  When a solid comes in contact with a liquid, an interfacial double-layer will likely form.
  They are too small to feel or see so their presence goes mostly unnoticed at the macroscopic level.
  Double layers stabilise some of our most important fluids -- blood, milk, paints, and inks.
  Without the protection of double-layers, these mixtures clump and loose their fluidity.

  This thesis is separated into two parts, both linked to the behaviour of double-layers.
  In~\cref{part:doubleLayersOnInsulators} these layers are used as a means of converting fluid-mechanical energy into electrical energy.
  The primary application of such a harvester would be to power electronic water meters.
  Domestic water meters are typically installed where electrical connection is not feasible; harvesting energy here may makes electronic metering more feasible long-term.
  It turns out that double-layer based energy harvesters are not yet efficient enough for this application, but the future looks promising.

  \Cref{part:doubleLayersOnConductors} models the electrical impedance of submerged electrodes.
  Double-layers play a large part in determining the electrical impedance between metal-fluid interfaces.
  This work is important to designers of medical implants; and by extension, anybody who relies on the implants themselves.
  Engineers use solutions of saline to mimic the situation seen by their implants in a person.
  This gives them a way to test the implant without injuring anyone.
  A way of characterising the interface between electrodes in solution is to model it mathematically.
  Such a model was created by my supervisor, Jonathan Scott.
  I use that model to compare electrodes placed in solutions of saline to those placed in a living animal.
  Measurements of the two show they are quite different from one another.
  I create a mixture of household ingredients that closely resembles the electrical impedance of a live animal.

%% Part 1 - Energy Harvesting

\part{Double Layers for Energy Harvesting}
  \label{part:doubleLayersOnInsulators}
  Part~\ref{part:doubleLayersOnInsulators} studies interfacial double layers on insulators.
  Here we will see how double layers can be used to perform electrical work.
  This relies specifically on the formation of double layers on insulating surfaces like glass.

  It was discussed in the introduction that double layers naturally form at liquid-solid interfaces.
  It was said that the double layer itself is a collection of charged ions.
  Can we collect this charge and use it to generate electrical power?
  Doing so would provide a method of energy harvesting without moving parts.
  During Part~\ref{part:doubleLayersOnInsulators}, I build such a harvester and look at applying it to smart water metering.
  With reference to that application I create a power budget and discuss the practicalities.
