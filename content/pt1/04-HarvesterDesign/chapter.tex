The main purpose of developing the power harvesting unit outlined
in \ref{part:Power-Harvesting} is to operate a wireless sensor node,
or mote. In this part I will outline the combinations of hardware
and software used to operate the sensing, power management and radio
communication elements of the sensor.


\section{The first prototype}

An initial prototype - while not able to energy harvest - provides
a starting point for further wireless sensing nodes and sets a baseline
for energy performance evaluation. The wireless battery operated sensing
node used a Microchip PIC16F886 microcontroller and RFM12B radio transciever,
having power requirements as already assesed in \ref{part:Power-consumption}.
One of the primary purposes of building such a limited prototype was
to ensure that I was infact able to build something capable of sensing
and relaying data autonomously, which has been achieved. As there
is little academic value in the construction of this device, I will
talk only briefly about its construction.
