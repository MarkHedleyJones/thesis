Soon we will see how double layers can be used to perform electrical work.
Doing so relies specifically on the formation of double layers on insulating surfaces like glass.
Part \ref{part:doubleLayersOnInsulators} studies interfacial double layers on insulators.

It was discussed in the introduction that double layers naturally form at liquid-solid interfaces.
It was said that the double layer itself is a collection of charged ions.
Can we collect this charge and use it to generate electrical power?
Doing so would provide a method of energy harvesting without moving parts.
I look at a smart application of a water such a harvester, create a power budget, and discuss the design of a practical harvester.

\chapter{Introduction}
  \label{chap:harvesterIntroduction}
  This introductory chapter provides background reading specific to energy harvesting.
  It builds upon the preceding introductory material of double layers and is steered toward energy conversion.
  Here we are concerned with double layer formation on solid boundaries that are non-conducting, such as glass.
  We will discuss how this can be used to convert fluid-mechanical power into electrical power.
  At this point it is assumed the reader knows what a double layer is and how they are formed.

  \section{Background}

    Charge separation is not enough to generate electrical power.
    Electrical power can not be taken directly from a double layer because:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The counter-ions of a double layer are electrostatically bound to the interface.
            Removing these ions from the interface requires work.
        \item The double layer blocks the electric field from the interface.
            Charge migration stops once the layer has created an equal and opposite field at the interface.
    \end{itemize}

        \caption{\label{fig:doubleLayerOnWall}A double layer formed on a wall}
    \end{figure}

    Figure~\ref{fig:doubleLayerOnWall} depicts a double layer formed at a charged wall.
    It has the same structure as the layers examined around a particle, with the exception that it is flat.

    We know the double layer envelopes solids with a layer of oppositely charged ions.
    We also know that the thickness of the double layer is dependant on both the surface charge density of the wall and the ionic concentration in the solution.

    %     \caption{\label{fig:ionsInABox}Charge distribution in a charged cavity versus a non-charged cavity}
    % \end{figure}

    % Now imagine a very small cavity filled with an electrolyte.
    % A simplified representation of such a cavity is shown in figure \ref{fig:ionsInABox}.
    % If the walls of the cavity hold no surface charge then the ions distribute evenly throughout the volume.
    % That is to say, the ions in the liquid are not electrically influenced by the walls.
    % With the application of surface charge - the counter-ions migrate to the walls.
    % As the density of counter-ions has increased at the interface, a void of cations remains within the cavity.
    % The charge has been separated.

        \caption{\label{fig:doubleLayerBetweenWalls}Formation of a double layer between two  walls}
    \end{figure}

    Now lets imagine bringing another wall in toward the first (as shown in figure~\ref{fig:doubleLayerBetweenWalls}).
    By controlling the thickness of the double layer and the distance between the walls, it is possible to overlap the double layers.
    Bringing these walls together acts to repel any co-ions from between the walls.
    Removing the co-ions increases the counter-ion concentration with the body of liquit between the walls

    Double layers are usually very thin, in the order of nanometers, so overlapping them requires very small geometries.
    Geometries formed for this purpose are very narrow channels, whose walls contain trapped charge.

        \includegraphics{content/pt1/01-PowerHarvesting/graphics/streamingCell}
        \caption{\label{fig:streamingCellChannel} Simplified diagram of a streaming cell channel between two reservoirs}
    \end{figure}



    % A streaming potential is simply a very thin cavity separating two volumes.
    % The walls of the cavity are separated by a distance in the order of a couple of double layers.
    % These dimensions are such that double layers within the cavity overlap.
    % By overlapping double layers, the volume of liquid within the cavity is primarily comprised of double layer counter-ions.

    % The streaming potential cell is a device that uses water flow to separate charge.
    % It is particularly promising as a harvester due to its lack of moving parts.
    % This chapter starts by explaining how a streaming cell makes use of the interfacial double layer to separate charge.
    % Then I construct a crude cell and measure its performance.
    % This is followed by a mathematical investigation of the streaming cell.

    % For the sake of brevity, the term `cell' in this chapter shall refer to a streaming potential cell.
    % And the term `interface' refers to the interface, or boundary, between solid and liquid matter.
    % Unless otherwise stated, it should be assumed that I am describing the liquid side of the interface.
    % The solid body typically plays no role, apart from the surface charge it holds.

    % \begin{figure}
    %     \centering
    %     \includegraphics{content/pt1/01-PowerHarvesting/graphics/doubleLayerOnWall}
    %     \caption{\label{fig:doubleLayerOnWall}Formation of a double layer on a wall}
    % \end{figure}

    % Figure \ref{fig:doubleLayerOnWall} shows the formation of a double layer at the interface of a charged wall.
    % A higher density of positively charged ions, or cations, sit close to the interface.
    % The density of these cations reduces as the distance to the interface increases.
    % Also, the density of negatively charged ions, or anions, increases with the distance from the interface.


    To cause continuous charge separation, the cell is placed across a pressure gradient.
    This pressure gradient causes the counter-ions within the cavity to be pumped through the cell.
    As counter-ions are moved through the cavity, more counter-ions move to the replenish the layer at the opening.
    The counter-ions accumulate at the exit side of the cell.
    This scenario is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:streamingCellPrinciple}.

    Streaming potential cells are not new.
    They find use in collodial science as a means of measuring the zeta potential of a double layer \cite{Gu2000,Scales1992,Daiguji2004,VanderHeyden2006,Mala1997}.
    At the beginning of this work it was believed that harvesting power from streaming cells had not been done before.




    a cavity forcing water through narrow cavities. This phenomenon is understood
    and is used in colloidal science to determine what's called the zeta potential
    of an interface \cite{Gu2000,Scales1992,Daiguji2004,VanderHeyden2006,Mala1997}.
    Although this phenomenon isn't new, using it to generate useful amounts of
    electrical energy is. This chapter will investigate the application of
    streaming potentials to energy harvesting for the purposes of running a smart
    water meter.

    % At the boundary between a liquid and a solid, be it a molecule or the wall of
    % a container, there is a possibility for an electrical potential. This
    % electrical potential exists at the interface between the liquid and the solid
    % and is the underlying mechanism by which the streaming potential cell
    % operates. To understand how this electrical potential is able to separate
    % charge as it does in a streaming potential cell we will first observe what
    % happens when a solid suspended in liquid, as is shown in Figure
    % \ref{Figure_Diagram_ZetaPotential_and_SlippingPlane}.


    \begin{figure} \centering
        \includegraphics{content/pt1/01-PowerHarvesting/graphics/streamingCellPrinciple}
        \caption{\label{fig:streamingCellPrinciple}The general principle of
            operation of the streaming potential cell} \end{figure} In this
    diagram, a the negatively charged solid is surrounded by layers of positively
    charged ions that are electrostaticly attracted to the surface of the solid.
    Near the surface of the solid, tightly bound, positively charged ions are
    packed together and are largely immobile.  These ions reside in what is called
    the Stern Layer. After this layer is a shell of less densely packed and
    somewhat mobile ions that are still bound to the solid. At the edge of this
    shell is what is called the slipping plane, which is the point at which ions
    are no-longer bound to the solid. The electrical potential at this slipping
    plane is termed the $\zeta$ potential (zeta potential). ``This zeta potential
    is directly related to the interaction between the solid particles themselves
    when they are suspended in a liquid and thus determines the stability of the
    suspension solutions'' \cite{Gu2000}.

    % showing the ionic concentration and potential difference as a function of
    % distance from the charged surface of a particle suspended in a dispersion
    % medium.} \end{figure}


    Now lets look at the case where the geometry is such that the surface charge
    resides on the walls of a channel through which the liquid can flow, as is
    shown in Figure \ref{Figure_Diagram_ZetaPotential_and_in_a_channel}.  By
    setting the width of the channel such that the double layer formed on each of
    the sides partially overlap, the channel will be predominantly occupied by ions
    of the opposite polarity to that of the surface charge at the solid to liquid
    interface. This configuration has the effect of promoting the transport of
    those ions across the channel with the application of a pressure differential
    across the channels length.

  We expect the lack moving parts in that design will reduce or eliminate maintenance costs.
  Such a low maintenance harvester is ideal for water utility companies to measure and record water usage.
