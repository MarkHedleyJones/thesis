Part~\ref{part:doubleLayersOnInsulators} studies interfacial double layers on insulators.
Here we will see how double layers can be used to perform electrical work.
This relies specifically on the formation of double layers on insulating surfaces like glass.

It was discussed in the introduction that double layers naturally form at liquid-solid interfaces.
It was said that the double layer itself is a collection of charged ions.
Can we collect this charge and use it to generate electrical power?
Doing so would provide a method of energy harvesting without moving parts.
During Part~\ref{part:doubleLayersOnInsulators}, I build such a harvester and look at applying it to smart water metering.
With reference to that application I create a power budget and discuss the practicalities.

\chapter{Introduction}
  \label{chap:harvesterIntroduction}
  This introductory chapter provides background reading specific to energy harvesting.
  It builds upon the preceding introductory material of double layers and is steered toward energy conversion.
  We will discuss how double layers can be used to convert fluid-mechanical power into electrical power.
  At this point it is assumed the reader knows what a double layer is and how one is formed.

  \section{Streaming Cells}

        \caption{\label{fig:doubleLayerBetweenWalls}Formation of a double layer along a solid wall}
    \end{figure}

    We begin by looking at double layers formed along the walls of a container.
    Such a situation is presented in \ref{fig:doubleLayerBetweenWalls}, where the walls are negatively charged and hence the counter-ions are positive.
    Counter-ions that have been separated from the bulk of the liquid line the exterior of the wall.
    However, charge separation alone is not enough to generate electrical power.

    As energy cannot simply be created or destroyed, it must be converted between forms.
    The counter-ions are electrostatically bound to the interface - removing them requires work.
    Although the counter-ion density has been increased at the boundary, the charge is not free.
    Also, the migration of charge to the walls ceases once the surface potential has been neutralised; so it is not a continuous process.

    \begin{figure}
        \centering
        \includegraphics{content/pt1/01-PowerHarvesting/graphics/intro_2_channel}
        \caption{\label{fig:doubleLayerInChannel_noPressure}Double layer formation within a cell geometry}
    \end{figure}

    Generating electrical power will require taking mechanical energy from the fluid.
    It will manifest itself as a drop in pressure across a harvester as liquid is forced through.
    This is very similar to the voltage drop observed across a resistor as it passes current.

    Developing an electrical potential in a liquid requires upsetting the ionic balance.
    This means separating and isolate negative and positive ions from each other.
    The collection of free (unbound) counter-ions can be achieved by pumping and collecting those ions from within the double layer.

    Figure~\ref{fig:doubleLayerInChannel_noPressure} shows another charged wall, but with the addition of a small channel.
    This channel connects two bodies of liquid that have been separated by the wall.
    Notice that the channel contains no co-ions, it is exclusively occupied by counter-ions.
    In reality there may be some co-ions; the proportion of which is controlled by the width of the channel.

    Ideally, the width of the channel will be in the order of the double layer thickness.
    The situation depicted in figure~\ref{fig:doubleLayerInChannel_noPressure} is small enough that the double layers will overlap.
    By overlapping the double layers, or bringing their boundaries together, co-ions will be repelled from between the walls.
    This provides the most concentrated counter-ion density within the channel.

    The channel and the two bodies have now formed a harvester.
    By applying a pressure differential across the channel, counter-ion rich is transported across the wall.
    As the ions exit the channel on the low-pressure side, new counter-ions move to replenish the double layer on the high-pressure side.
    Once charge has crossed the channel it is difficult for it to return as the constant flow of liquid opposes charge migration back through the wall.
    
    The channel is able to continuiously pump ions across a wall.
    Once started, the electrical potential between the two bodies will increase.
    Not only is the channel increasing the concentration of free counter ions on the low-pressure side, but it also concentrates co-ions on the high-pressure side.
    In the case of glass as the channel/wall material, this means the low-pressure side will have a higher potential than that of the high-pressure side.
    This is also the situation illustrated in the proceeding graphics.

    The mechanism described here is the streaming potential cell.
    It is a device at the centre of research in both membrane and interface science.
    The concept behind the device is relatively straight-forward, but the physical reality is more complicated.
    The diagrams presented are vastly oversimplified, having perfectly flat walls, single atom ions carrying a single charge, and omitting polar molecules or contaminants.
    The current literature will be reviewed in the next section relating to these cells.

  \section{Literature Review}

    Streaming potential cells are not new.
    They find use in collodial science as a means of measuring the zeta potential of a double layer \cite{Gu2000,Scales1992,Daiguji2004,VanderHeyden2006,Mala1997}.
    At the beginning of this work it was believed that harvesting power from streaming cells had not been done before.




    a cavity forcing water through narrow cavities. This phenomenon is understood
    and is used in colloidal science to determine what's called the zeta potential
    of an interface \cite{Gu2000,Scales1992,Daiguji2004,VanderHeyden2006,Mala1997}.
    Although this phenomenon isn't new, using it to generate useful amounts of
    electrical energy is. This chapter will investigate the application of
    streaming potentials to energy harvesting for the purposes of running a smart
    water meter.

    % At the boundary between a liquid and a solid, be it a molecule or the wall of
    % a container, there is a possibility for an electrical potential. This
    % electrical potential exists at the interface between the liquid and the solid
    % and is the underlying mechanism by which the streaming potential cell
    % operates. To understand how this electrical potential is able to separate
    % charge as it does in a streaming potential cell we will first observe what
    % happens when a solid suspended in liquid, as is shown in Figure
    % \ref{Figure_Diagram_ZetaPotential_and_SlippingPlane}.


    \begin{figure} \centering
        \includegraphics{content/pt1/01-PowerHarvesting/graphics/streamingCellPrinciple}
        \caption{\label{fig:streamingCellPrinciple}The general principle of
            operation of the streaming potential cell} \end{figure} In this
    diagram, a the negatively charged solid is surrounded by layers of positively
    charged ions that are electrostaticly attracted to the surface of the solid.
    Near the surface of the solid, tightly bound, positively charged ions are
    packed together and are largely immobile.  These ions reside in what is called
    the Stern Layer. After this layer is a shell of less densely packed and
    somewhat mobile ions that are still bound to the solid. At the edge of this
    shell is what is called the slipping plane, which is the point at which ions
    are no-longer bound to the solid. The electrical potential at this slipping
    plane is termed the $\zeta$ potential (zeta potential). ``This zeta potential
    is directly related to the interaction between the solid particles themselves
    when they are suspended in a liquid and thus determines the stability of the
    suspension solutions'' \cite{Gu2000}.

    % showing the ionic concentration and potential difference as a function of
    % distance from the charged surface of a particle suspended in a dispersion
    % medium.} \end{figure}


    Now lets look at the case where the geometry is such that the surface charge
    resides on the walls of a channel through which the liquid can flow, as is
    shown in Figure \ref{Figure_Diagram_ZetaPotential_and_in_a_channel}.  By
    setting the width of the channel such that the double layer formed on each of
    the sides partially overlap, the channel will be predominantly occupied by ions
    of the opposite polarity to that of the surface charge at the solid to liquid
    interface. This configuration has the effect of promoting the transport of
    those ions across the channel with the application of a pressure differential
    across the channels length.

  This chapter demonstrates an energy harvesting device capable of harvesting energy from flowing water with no moving parts.
  A `smart' use for such a harvester is discussed in chapter \ref{chap:wirelessWaterMetering}.
  I find the minimum power a harvester needs to harvest in order to be useful in chapter \ref{chap:energyRequirements}.
  And finally, in chapter \ref{chap:harvesterDesign}, I discuss the design of a harvester and comment on its feasibility.

  A method of power harvesting was put forward in chapter \ref{chap:harvestingEnergy} that used water flow as a source of energy.
  We expect the lack moving parts in that design will reduce or eliminate maintenance costs.
  Such a low maintenance harvester is ideal for water utility companies to measure and record water usage.
  This chapter discusses how such a water meter might be implemented.
  The content in this chapter is used as the basis for investigating the energy requirements of such a harvester.
