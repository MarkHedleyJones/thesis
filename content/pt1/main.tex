Here I investigate the use of double layers for harvesting energy.
This relates to layers that have formed on insulating surfaces, such as glass.

It was discussed in the introduction that double layers naturally form at liquid-solid interfaces.
It was said that the double layer itself is a collection of charged ions.
Can we collect this charge and convert it into electrical energy?
Doing so would provide a method of energy harvesting without moving parts.
I look at a smart application of a water such a harvester, create a power budget, and discuss the design of a practical harvester.

\chapter{Introduction}
  \label{chap:harvesterIntroduction}
  Like chapter \ref{chap:introduction_main}, this chapter gives the reader some background on double layers.
  It builds upon the previous discussion of double layers and is steered toward energy harvesting.
  Here we are concerned with double layer formation on solid boundaries that are non-conducting, such as glass.
  We will discuss how this can be used to convert fluid-mechanical power into electrical power.

  \section{Background}
    It was mentioned earlier that double layers form between charged solids and liquids.
    For this part (energy harvesting) we will examine double layers formed at the edge of a wall.
    This is in contrast to the double layers that formed around particulates in solution.

        \caption{\label{fig:doubleLayerOnWall}Formation of a double layer on a wall}
    \end{figure}

    Figure~\ref{fig:doubleLayerOnWall} depicts a double layer that has formed along a charged wall.
    It has the same structure as the layers examined around a particle, with the exception that it is flat.

    From the main introduction we know that the thickness of a double layer is dependant on the surface charge density of the solid and the ionic concentration in the fluid.
    Therefore, various liquids in contact with different solids will form layers of differing sizes.
    The double layer thickness is described by the Debye length.






  \section{Literature Review}

\chapter{The Streaming Cell Energy Harvester}
  \label{chap:harvestingEnergy}

  This chapter demonstrates an energy harvesting device capable of harvesting energy from flowing water with no moving parts.
  A `smart' use for such a harvester is discussed in chapter \ref{chap:wirelessWaterMetering}.
  I find the minimum power a harvester needs to harvest in order to be useful in chapter \ref{chap:energyRequirements}.
  And finally, in chapter \ref{chap:harvesterDesign}, I discuss the design of a harvester and comment on its feasibility.

  \section{Current Trends in Water Metering}
  \section{Appropriatenes of Streaming Cell Harvesters}

  A method of power harvesting was put forward in chapter \ref{chap:harvestingEnergy} that used water flow as a source of energy.
  We expect the lack moving parts in that design will reduce or eliminate maintenance costs.
  Such a low maintenance harvester is ideal for water utility companies to measure and record water usage.
  This chapter discusses how such a water meter might be implemented.
  The content in this chapter is used as the basis for investigating the energy requirements of such a harvester.
