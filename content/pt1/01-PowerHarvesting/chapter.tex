%\paragraph{Analogy to electronics}
%
%Harvesting energy from water flowing through a pipe will inevitably
%mean robbing that flow of pressure. An analogy of this in the electronics
%domain is the placement of a resistance in series with a flow of electrical
%current, causing a drop in voltage across that resistance. Where the
%series resistance in an electronic circuit would dissipate power in
%the form of heat, the energy harvesting mechanism will instead provide
%an electrical output for use by the metering electronics. Although
%simple, this analogy makes the effect of placing a meter in a pipe
%of water easier to understand.

One practical application of the interfacial double layer is that of electrical energy harvesting. As was discussed in the introduction, a double layer is a naturally formed of a layer of like-charged ions and molecules surrounding the surface of a charged solid. The previous sentence is especially important, it essentially states: \emph{free charge naturally accumulates in certain predictable places}. Now we ask the question ``can we collect this charge and put the charge to use?''

Part \ref{part:doubleLayersOnInsulators} of this thesis explains how harvesting energy from double layers may be done, quantifies how much energy one may want to generate and concludes by stating what such a harvester would look like and its feasibility.



\section{The streaming potential cell}

A streaming potential cell is an apparatus that enables charge separation
simply by forcing water through narrow cavities. This phenomenon is
understood and is used in colloidal science to determine what's called
the zeta potential of an interface \cite{Gu2000,Scales1992,Daiguji2004,VanderHeyden2006,Mala1997}.
Although this phenomenon isn't new, using it to generate useful amounts
of electrical energy is. This chapter will investigate the application
of streaming potentials to energy harvesting for the purposes of running
a smart water meter.

% At the boundary between a liquid and a solid, be it a molecule or
% the wall of a container, there is a possibility for an electrical
% potential. This electrical potential exists at the interface between
% the liquid and the solid and is the underlying mechanism by which
% the streaming potential cell operates. To understand how this electrical
% potential is able to separate charge as it does in a streaming potential
% cell we will first observe what happens when a solid suspended in
% liquid, as is shown in Figure \ref{Figure_Diagram_ZetaPotential_and_SlippingPlane}.

In this diagram, a the negatively charged solid is surrounded by layers
of positively charged ions that are electrostaticly attracted to the
surface of the solid. Near the surface of the solid, tightly bound,
positively charged ions are packed together and are largely immobile.
These ions reside in what is called the Stern Layer. After this layer
is a shell of less densely packed and somewhat mobile ions that are
still bound to the solid. At the edge of this shell is what is called
the slipping plane, which is the point at which ions are no-longer
bound to the solid. The electrical potential at this slipping plane
is termed the $\zeta$ potential (zeta potential). ``This zeta potential
is directly related to the interaction between the solid particles
themselves when they are suspended in a liquid and thus determines
the stability of the suspension solutions'' \cite{Gu2000}.

Now lets look at the case where the geometry is such that the surface
charge resides on the walls of a channel through which the liquid
can flow, as is shown in Figure \ref{Figure_Diagram_ZetaPotential_and_in_a_channel}.
By setting the width of the channel such that the double layer formed
on each of the sides partially overlap, the channel will be predominantly
occupied by ions of the opposite polarity to that of the surface charge
at the solid to liquid interface. This configuration has the effect
of promoting the transport of those ions across the channel with the
application of a pressure differential across the channels length.

\section{Replicating an experiment}

There are many papers describing experiments with streaming potential
cells \cite{Gu2000,Mala1997,Scales1992,VanderHeyden2006} of which
we have chosen one by Yongan Gu and Dongqing Li \cite{Gu2000} to
attempt to replicate. This paper was chosen for its detailed description
of the experimental procedure used, including the brands and model
numbers of the equipment used. Our experimental procedure is based
upon this paper however we have modified certain areas of the experiment
to accommodate for the resources available to us. For a list of the
materials used to construct the channels, see Table \ref{Table_StreamingCell_MaterialsUsed}.


\subsection{\label{sub:Experimental-Procedure}Experimental Procedure}


\subsubsection{Construction}

\end{figure}


First, glass microscope slides where cut in half to give panels of
glass that where approximately 26 x 38mm. Once such glass panel can
be seen in Figure \ref{Photo_streamingPotential_Assembly_Step1}.
Next, two pieces of shim material where placed on either side of the
glass panel with a small amount of epoxy, on top of which another
glass panel was placed. Pressure was applied to the panels pressing
them together while the epoxy set to create the channel that can be
seen in Figure \ref{Photo_streamingPotential_Assembly_Step2}. Each
channel was photographed under microscope once set to determine the
height of the channel created. Finally, acrylic couplers where mounted
over each end, again by the use of epoxy. These couplers allowed the
water to be forced through the channel while providing mounting for
the voltage sensing wires. The final assembly is shown in Figure \ref{Photo_streamingPotential_Assembly_Step3}.


\subsubsection{Measurement}

Each assembly was connected between the tap and drain of a lab basin.
To facilitate measurement of the pressure gradient across the channel,
a pressure transducer was placed across the input and output ports
of the channel assembly. Single core copper wire was used to measure
voltage gradients across the channel. These wires where epoxied into
the couplers to reduce leaks. To conduct the measurements an Agilent
E5270B Precision Measurement Mainframe was used, which has an input
impedance of 10${\displaystyle \, T\Omega}$. The high input impedance
of this machine ensures that the measurements are not disturbed by
current leaking through the measurement device. The E5270 was responsible
for measuring the output of the pressure transducer and the voltage
across the channel.


\subsection{Results}

Ten cavities ranging in height from 26$\,\mu m$ to 245$\,\mu m$
where built and measured. Individual plots showing pressure applied
versus voltage developed are shown in Appendix \ref{sec:Appendix-Streaming-Potential-Cell}.
For convenience, a graph with the steepest voltage per pressure gradient
is shown in Figure \ref{fig:streamingCell_voltVsPress_52um_convienient},
which resulted from using a cell with a height of 52$\,\mu m$.

\begin{figure}[H]

showing voltage output versus pressure for a 52$\,\mu m$ glass micro-channel.}
\end{figure}


From the results obtained it is clear that there is a definite \nobreakdash-
linear \nobreakdash- relationship between the amount of pressure
applied and the voltage developed across each channel. Figure \ref{fig:streamingCell_scatter_voltGradVsHeight}
compares the gradient of voltage developed per PSI of pressure for
each of the channels. The graph shows a trend toward larger voltage
development as channel height is reduced to around 50$\,\mu m$. Below
50$\,\mu m$ it is unclear what to expect from the channel which will
require further investigation. Spread in the data is expected to be
the result of epoxy (used to glue the slides together) seeping into
the cavity, thereby slightly altering each cavity's dimensions.

channels.}


\end{figure}



\subsection{Conclusion}

Power generation from streaming potential cells is possible, this
is evident from the voltages developed in this experiment. The streaming
cell is capable of producing output when operated using standard tap
water at standard tap pressures. As yet, the amount of current that
can be drawn from such a channel has not been ascertained, and therefore
the amount of available power remains unknown (although it is estimated
to be in the very small). An initial estimate of the ideal channel
lies between 25-75$\,\mu m$ in height.


\section{Governing model}


\subsection{Charge separation analysis}

As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, for a streaming potential
cell to operate there must be an electrical potential at the interface
between solid and liquid matter. In the experiment that Wayne Crump
and myself replicated, the solid/liquid interface was between glass
and standard Hamilton tap water, so where does this electrical potential
come from?

Quoting Tandon et al. in \cite{Tandon2008}: Many microfluidic substrates
behave as weak acids in aqueous solutions. In glass substrates, surface
silanol groups can be deprotonated in aqueous solutions leaving a
negative surface charge:

\begin{equation}
SiOH\overset{^{K_{a}}}{\mathbf{\rightleftharpoons}}SiO^{-}+H^{+}
\end{equation}


It is this deprotonation that is responsible for generating the charge
difference at the glass/liquid surface of the microchannel and therefore
establishing an electrical double layer (EDL). Since the charge imbalance
in this case arises from the fact that the glass behaves as a weak
acid, the process itself is affected by the pH of the liquid, something
we have no control over when using tap water.

Once an ionic double layer within the channel has been established,
``the streaming potential is engendered by the flow of the ions relative
to the stationary charged wall of the channel'' \cite{Mansouri2005}.
This flow is accomplished in our case by applying a pressure gradient
across the channel. ``The ratio of streaming potential to pressure
gradient depends on the zeta potential''\cite{Park2009}


\subsection{\label{sub:StreamingCell-Mathematics}Mathematics}

The first step toward optimisation is to define all the parameters
that describe the device. The streaming current, which is defined
as the electrical current that flows in the direction of water flow,
is defined in \cite{Olthuis2005} to be:

\begin{equation}
I_{s}=\frac{A\,\varepsilon_{0\,}\varepsilon_{r}}{\eta\, l}\Delta P\,\zeta\label{eq:StreamingCell_StreamingCurrentFunc}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{description}
\item [{$\varepsilon_{0}$}] is the permittivity of free space
\item [{$\varepsilon_{r}$}] is the relative permittivity of the liquid
\item [{$\eta$}] is the viscosity of the liquid
\item [{$l$}] is the length of the channel
\item [{$\Delta P$}] is the pressure difference across the channel
\item [{$\zeta$}] is the zeta-potential of the of the glass-liquid interface
\item [{$A$}] is the cross-sectional area of the channel, or combined
area of multiple channels
\end{description}
This equation indicates that the cell will produce a current that
is proportional to the amount of pressure across it and that the output
is affected by the geometry of the channel itself. To help model the
situation it is convenient to break Equation \ref{eq:StreamingCell_StreamingCurrentFunc}
formula down in the following manner:
\begin{eqnarray}
I_{s} & = & \Delta P\,\left(\frac{A}{\eta\, l}\right)\,\left(\varepsilon_{0}\,\varepsilon_{r}\,\zeta\right)\nonumber \\
I_{s} & = & \frac{\Delta P}{\left(\frac{\eta\, l}{A}\right)}\,\left(\varepsilon_{0}\,\varepsilon_{r}\,\zeta\right)\nonumber \\
I_{s} & = & \frac{\Delta P}{R_{h}}\,\left(\varepsilon_{0}\,\varepsilon_{r}\,\zeta\right)\label{eq:StreamingCurrent_HydrostaticResistance}\\
\frac{I_{s}}{\Delta P} & = & \frac{\varepsilon_{0}\,\varepsilon_{r}\,\zeta}{R_{h}}\nonumber \\
g_{m} & = & \frac{\varepsilon_{0}\,\varepsilon_{r}\,\zeta}{R_{h}}\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}


where $R_{h}$ is the hydrodynamic resistance caused by the channel,
$g_{m}$ represents the transconductance between pressure applied
and current produced and $I_{s}$ is the streaming current. The hydrodynamic
resistance ($R_{h}$) will be affected by the geometry of the channel
so $R_{h}$ is considered an approximation of the hydrodynamic resistance.

Once the cell begins to separate charge a current in the reverse direction
is established called the conduction current ($I_{c}$).

Ohms law states:

\[
I=\frac{V}{R}
\]


In this situation the resistance is determined by the conductivity
of the water ($\sigma$), as well as the cross sectional area ($A$)
and length ($l$) of the channel.

\[
R=\frac{l}{\sigma\, A}
\]


Therefore, the conduction current back through the channel is determined
by:

\begin{equation}
I_{c}=A\sigma\frac{V_{s}}{l}
\end{equation}


Where $\sigma$ is the conductivity of the liquid and $V_{s}$ is
the voltage developed across the channel. This is also shown in

At equlibrium the streaming current ($I_{s}$) and the conduction
current ($I_{c}$) are equal and opposite in direction.


\subsection{\label{sub:Electrical-model}Electrical model}

Figure \ref{fig:StreamingCell_Schematic-representation} depicts schematically
how a streaming cell would operate when connected to an external load.
This model is based upon that found in \cite{Olthuis2005} by Olthuis
et al. but has been modified to show the pressure applied ($\Delta P$)
as the voltage source, instead of the zeta potential ($\zeta$). It
is the pressure that responsible for creating the streaming current;
a zeta potential on its own simply isn't enough. This has been shown
through the results obtained in Appendix \ref{sec:Appendix-Streaming-Potential-Cell},
where $V_{s}$ was directly proportional to $\Delta P$; as $V_{s}$
is directly related to $I_{s}$ as per Ohm's law.

\par\end{centering}

\protect\caption{\label{fig:StreamingCell_Schematic-representation}Schematic representation
of a streaming cell with attached output resistance}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Output analysis}

The electrical model described in \ref{sub:Electrical-model} shows
how the cell would operate with a load placed across the cell. By
combining this model with the equations from \ref{sub:StreamingCell-Mathematics}
it should be possible to see the effect that altering various cell
parameters has on the output.

\begin{eqnarray}
P & = & V\times I\nonumber \\
V & = & I\times R\nonumber \\
P & = & I^{2}\times R\nonumber \\
P_{out} & = & I_{out}^{2}\times R_{out}\nonumber \\
I_{out} & = & I_{s}\times\frac{R_{cell}}{R_{cell}+R_{out}}\nonumber \\
P_{out} & = & \left[I_{s}\times\frac{R_{cell}}{R_{cell}+R_{out}}\right]^{2}\times R_{out}\label{eq:DeterminingOutputPower}
\end{eqnarray}



\subsubsection{Finding an optimum value for $R_{out}$}

Using Ohm's Law it is possible to find an equation that give the output
power as a function of the electrical resistance of the cell ($R_{cell)}$)
and the output resistance ($R_{out}$) as shown in Equation \ref{eq:DeterminingOutputPower}.
In order to optimise the output power it is necessary to find the
value of output resistance ($R_{out}$) that maximises the output
power.

Next I take Equation \ref{eq:DeterminingOutputPower} and treat the
streaming current ($I_{s}$) as a constant, differentiate with respect
to $R_{out}$ and find the condition that gives a maximum/minimum
power output.

\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{\partial P_{out}}{\partial R_{out}} & = & \frac{R_{cell}^{2}}{(R_{cell}+R_{out})^{2}}-\frac{2\times R_{cell}^{2}\times R_{out}}{(R_{cell}+R_{out})^{3}}\\
0 & = & \frac{R_{cell}^{2}}{(R_{cell}+R_{out})^{2}}-\frac{2\times R_{cell}^{2}\times R_{out}}{(R_{cell}+R_{out})^{3}}\\
\frac{2\times R_{cell}^{2}\times R_{out}}{(R_{cell}+R_{out})^{3}} & = & \frac{R_{cell}^{2}}{(R_{cell}+R_{out})^{2}}\\
\frac{2\times R_{cell}^{2}\times R_{out}}{R_{cell}+R_{out}} & = & R_{cell}^{2}\\
2\times R_{cell}^{2}\times R_{out} & = & R_{cell}^{2}\times(R_{cell}+R_{out})\\
2\times R_{out} & = & R_{cell}+R_{out}\\
R_{out} & = & R_{cell}
\end{eqnarray*}


This shows that there is either maximum or minimum power transfer
to $R_{out}$ when the value of $R_{out}$ matches that of $R_{cell}$,
which is shown to be a maximum as per Figure \ref{fig:Plot-of-PowerThereom}.
This result is consistant with that of the Maximum Power Thereom,
which I had trouble finding a reference of for a current source and
resistances in parallel. It shows that in order to achieve the maximum
possible output power, that the load should have a resistance equal
to that of the electrical resistance of the cell itself. Additionally,
it was found that the absolute magnitudes of both $R_{out}$ and $R_{cell}$
have no effect on the output power, so long as they are equal to one
another.

\begin{figure}
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics{/home/mark/Dropbox/University/PhD/Thesis/Graphs/powerThereom/maximumPowerThereom}
\par\end{centering}

\protect\caption{\label{fig:Plot-of-PowerThereom}Plot of Equation \ref{eq:DeterminingOutputPower}
when $I_{s}=1A$ and $R_{cell}=1\Omega$}
\end{figure}


This can now be used to calculate the maximum available power as a
function of $I_{s}$ by substituting $R_{out}$ and $R_{cell}$ for
$R$ , as $R_{out}=R_{cell}=R$:

\begin{eqnarray}
P_{out} & = & \left[I_{s}\times\frac{R_{cell}}{R_{cell}+R_{out}}\right]^{2}\times R_{out}\nonumber \\
P_{max} & = & \left[I_{s}\times\frac{1}{2}\right]^{2}\times R\nonumber \\
P_{max} & = & \frac{I_{s}^{2}R}{2}\label{eq:streamingCell_maxPower}
\end{eqnarray}


And as $P=I^{2}R$ (via the power equation and Ohm's Law) this indicates
that at most we can hope to havest half of the total power, while
the other half is dissipated back through $R_{cell}$. Combining Equations
\ref{eq:streamingCell_maxPower} and \ref{eq:StreamingCurrent_HydrostaticResistance}
gives:

\begin{eqnarray*}
P_{max} & = & \frac{\left(\frac{\Delta P}{R_{h}}\,\left(\varepsilon_{0}\,\varepsilon_{r}\,\zeta\right)\right)^{2}R}{2}\\
P_{max} & = & \frac{\left(\frac{\Delta P\,\varepsilon\,\zeta}{R_{h}}\right)^{2}R}{2}\\
P_{max} & = & \frac{\Delta P^{2}\,\varepsilon^{2}\,\zeta^{2}R}{2R_{h}^{2}}
\end{eqnarray*}


where $\varepsilon=\varepsilon_{0}\,\varepsilon_{r}$ and $R=R_{cell}=R_{out}$
. If we now substitute $R$ and $R_{h}$ for their respective functions
we end up with:

\begin{eqnarray}
P_{max} & = & \frac{\Delta P^{2}\,\varepsilon^{2}\,\zeta^{2}R}{2R_{h}^{2}}\nonumber \\
P_{max} & = & \frac{\Delta P^{2}\,\varepsilon^{2}\,\zeta^{2}\,\left(\frac{l}{\sigma\, A}\right)}{2\left(\frac{\eta\, l}{A}\right)_{h}^{2}}\nonumber \\
P_{max} & = & \frac{\Delta P^{2}\,\varepsilon^{2}\,\zeta^{2}\, l}{\sigma\, A}\times\frac{1}{\frac{2\eta^{2}\, l^{2}}{A^{2}}}\nonumber \\
P_{max} & = & \frac{\Delta P^{2}\,\varepsilon^{2}\,\zeta^{2}\, l\, A^{2}}{\sigma\, A\,2\eta^{2}\, l^{2}}\nonumber \\
P_{max} & = & \frac{\Delta P^{2}\,\varepsilon^{2}\,\zeta^{2}\, A}{2\,\sigma\,\eta^{2}\, l}\nonumber \\
P_{max} & \propto & \frac{\Delta P^{2}\,\zeta^{2}\, A}{l}\nonumber \\
P_{max} & \propto & \frac{\Delta P^{2}\,\zeta^{2}}{R_{h}}
\end{eqnarray}



\subsubsection{Optimisation of $R_{h}$ and $\Delta P$}

Knowing the optimum value of output resitance leaves only the streaming
current ($I_{s}$) and it's constituants as optimisation parameters.
Equation \ref{eq:StreamingCurrent_HydrostaticResistance} indicates
that in order to further optimise the cell, one must reduce hydrodynamic
resistance ($R_{h}$) and increase both the Zeta potential ($\xi$)
and pressure difference ($\Delta P$) placed across the cell.

We can model the water supply, harvester and a consumer as a basic
electrical circuit as shown in Figure \ref{fig:Schematic-model-of-harvester}.
In this model $P_{supply}$ represents the total water pressure available,
Flow represents the flow rate of water, $R_{h}$ and $R_{consumer}$
are the hydrodynamic resistances of the harvesting cell and a water
consumer (e.g. a house) respecively and $\Delta P$ is the pressure
developed difference across the harvester, where $R_{h}\propto\frac{l}{A}$.

\foreignlanguage{english}{$P_{max}$} for the harvester/consumer model
shown in Figure \ref{fig:Schematic-model-of-harvester}.}
\end{figure}
Figures \ref{fig:Effect-of-varying-Rh-onP}, \ref{fig:Effect-of-varying-Rh-onFlow}
and \ref{fig:Effect-of-varying-Rh-onIs} show how varying $R_{h}$
will affect $\Delta P$, the flow rate and the value of $\frac{\Delta P}{R_{h}}$
respectively. Notice in Figure \ref{fig:Effect-of-varying-Rh-onP}
that increasing $R_{h}$ has the effect of increasing $\Delta P$.
Optimisation wise, the benifit of increasing $I_{s}$ by increasing
$\Delta P$ is opposed by also increasing the value of $R_{h}$ (referring
to Equation \ref{eq:StreamingCurrent_HydrostaticResistance}).

Figure \ref{fig:Effect-of-varying-Rh-onFlow} shows how the value
of $R_{h}$ affects the flow rate through the system. Keeping the
flow rate high is important in order to ensure that the consumer does
not notice a drop in water pressure due to the addition of the harvester
in their water system.

Finally, Figure \ref{fig:Effect-of-varying-Rh-onIs} shows the effect
that varying $R_{h}$ has on \foreignlanguage{english}{$P_{max}$}
(according to $P_{max}\propto\frac{\Delta P^{2}\,\zeta^{2}}{R_{h}}$
when $\zeta=1$). The result is the same as that of Equation \ref{eq:DeterminingOutputPower},
showing that this is again goverend by the maximum power transfer
thereom. Practically, a harvester that dropped half of the supply
pressure would not be feasable in most domestic situations, so a trade-off
will have to be made that meets plumbing standards.


\subsubsection{Optimisation of the Zeta potential}

Referring back to Equation \ref{eq:StreamingCell_StreamingCurrentFunc},
I have determined how to increase the total output of the harvester
by choosing appropriate values for all of the parameters except $\varepsilon_{r}$
and $\zeta$. As the harvester will be using domestic tap water the
value of $\varepsilon_{r}$ will be that of the relative permittivity
of water, and is therefore relatively fixed (being only affected by
the temperature of the water). This leaves $\zeta$ as the remaining
parameter.
