In \cref{chap:harvestingEnergy} we discussed electric power generation from streaming cells.
I demonstrated a \SI{0.2}{\micro\percent} conversion efficiency from water flow and pressure.
I showed that streaming voltage is directly proportional to the pressure across a cell.
Can that pressure dependence give a way to meter water consumption while generating power? Probably.
However, questions like this are only relevant if the harvester is feasible.
To find that out, the following questions must be answered:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item What quantity of energy is there available to harvest?
  \item What fraction can be harnessed?
  \item How much power do we need?
\end{enumerate}
The answer to the second question was answered in \cref{chap:harvestingEnergy}, (\SI{0.0002}{\percent}; and the answer to the third will be answered in the in \cref{chap:energyRequirements}.
This chapter addresses the amount of energy available to harvest in a typical domestic setting.


\section{Current Trends in Water Metering}
  Domestic and commercial water metering is becoming increasingly common throughout the world~\cite{Chang2012}.
  Water sourcing and processing is an expensive task for city councils.
  Cheap and reliable methods for retrieving metering information will become more important as water becomes more precious.

  In New Zealand, larger districts, such as Auckland, Tauranga, and Wellington?, have already implemented water metering.
  Those cities have implemented traditional mechanical water metering systems.
  Meter readers are employed to visit each property and manually record the meters display.

  Automatic meter reading systems (AMR) are an alternative method of collecting that data.
  Hamilton City Council is trialling such systems in remote areas in the hopes of adopting them for wide-spread use.
  There are two types of automatic meter reading systems: an external reader/transmitter that attaches to a compatible meter, or meters built specifically for the purpose.

  Automatic meter reading systems offer advantages apart from removing the meter-man.
  Increasing the billing frequency helps customers reduce their consumption by giving greater feedback.
  Automatic systems remove the need for the customer to provide access to their property~\cite{Chang2012}.
  Electronic analysis of the meters readings provides an easy way to detect water leaks.
  It has been estimated that as much as \SI{10}{\percent} of post-meter water consumption is due to leakage in the residential sector.
  A study by Britton et al.\ found that by communicating with those customers whose water supply exhibited signs of leakages, a total reduction of  \SI{89}{\percent} of night-time flow rates was achieved.
  This is in contrast to a control group whose night-time usage increased by over \SI{50}{\percent}.
  The benefits of automatic water metering are not only geared toward fair pricing but detecting and monitoring the network as a whole.

  \end{figure}

  A domestic water meters are typically placed at a property's boundary in a plastic box set into the ground.
  A meter installation, typical of an Auckland residential area, is shown in~\cref{fig:Photo_DomesticWaterMeter}.
  The meter has been installed approximately eight meters into the property from the road-side.
  Because of its location, it is not feasible to connect it to a source of power.
  No commercially available domestic energy harvesting water meters, suitable for burial, exist on the market as of 2015.

      The device clips onto a compatable water meter and contains its own battery~\cite{BMeters2014}.
    }
  \end{figure}

  A common configuration for wireless automatic meter reading is to have a reader/transmitter device that is separate to the meter itself.
  Such a device usually attaches to the meter's display or has a wire connecting it to the meter.
  Being detachable and tamper-proof means it must be powered by batteries.
  A commonly stated battery life for such units is ten years~\cite{BMeters2014}, close to batteries shelf-life.

  We investigate the possibility of replacing these batteries with a streaming cell based energy harvester.
  A harvester would remove the need for batteries, but need to be plumbed into the feed.
  The resulting device would most likely replace the meter, as opposed to being an attachment. 

  \section{Envisioned harvester design}

    In \cref{chap:harvestingEnergy}, energy was converted between fluid-mechanical to electrical with a single channel.
    A harvester for the smart metering would likely require more energy than that channel was capable of generating.
    There are multiple ways of scaling the streaming cell design employed in \cref{chap:harvestingEnergy}.
    The channel can be made wider, doubling the width will double the output power;
    channels can be stacked, multiplying the output by the number of channels formed.
    Scaling the channels is not considered to be a problem.
    However, the pressure drop across a channel \emph{is} likely to be a problem to the consumer.

    \begin{figure}
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{content/pt1/02-WirelessWaterMeter/graphics/harvester}
      \caption{\label{fig:Diagram_harvester}Diagram showing the intended design of streaming cell harvester suitable for domestic connection.}
    \end{figure}

    To control the pressure drop across the harvester, the mechanical design shown as \cref{fig:Diagram_harvester} is proposed.
    It gives the capability of controlling the hydrodynamic resistance by means an orifice plate.
    The plate sits in the ``main line'' causing a pressure differential in proportion to the flow rate.
    A plate with a hole equal in diameter to the main pipe would cause no pressure across the harvester, as it causes no flow obstruction.
    A plate without a hole forces all flow through the harvester, causing maximum pressure differential.
    With an appropriate sized orifice plate the customer will be unaware of the harvester's presence in their water feed.
    
    For the sake of analysis, we assume that the plate will be sized to mimic the pressure loss of a mechanical water meter.
    This provides a way to determine how much energy would be available to a harvester by calculating how much is lost to existing mechanical meters.


  \section{Quantifying harvestable energy}

    Using streaming cell technology to harvest energy from a domestic water feed could increase the feasibility of automatic meter reading.

    This section determines the amount of energy available to an energy harvester.
    The harvester envisioned is intended for domestic water metering so we start by building a profile of domestic water consumption.
    Then by finding how much energy is lost inside a typical water meter we will know how much energy a harvester has available.

    \end{table}

    In 2008, Heinrich monitors water consumption of 51 homes throughout Auckland in 2008~\cite{Heinrich2008}.
    The report shows that the majority of domestic water is consumed by the shower (\SI{30}{\percent}), washing machine (\SI{27}{\percent}) and toilet (\SI{20}{\percent}).
    Together these account for over \SI{75}{\percent} of domestic water consumption.
    Data shown in \cref{tab:consumption_figures} was taken from that report in order to build a typical water usage profile.
    In 2007, Heinrich published a similar report which also contained water flow profiles~\cite{Heinrich2007} for each of the three items considered.

    Data from those reports has been used to build a domestic water usage profile.
    \Cref{fig:profileSample} shows the flow rates for each of the items
    The profile fits the usage statistics of a home with two occupants according to the previously mentioned reports over the duration of a week.

    During that time five uses of a washing machine, fourteen showers and fifty six toilet flushes occur.
    \Cref{fig:profileSample} shows
    A sample of the usage profiles of each item is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:profileSample}.

        \label{fig:powerDissipated_meter}
    \end{figure}

    Fig.~\ref{fig:headloss} shows the pressure head loss curve from a water meter typically installed at New Zealand homes (Kent PSMT 25mm)~\cite{WatercareNewZealand2014}.

    Using this curve we calculate power dissipation in a water meter during a washing machine cycle, shower, and toilet flush; presented as \cref{fig:powerDissipated_meter}.
    The total energy dissipated within the meter for each events is:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \SI{547}{\joule} per load of washing,
    \item \SI{222}{\joule} per shower, and
    \item \SI{24.3}{\joule} per flush of the toilet.
    \end{itemize}

% washing machine volume = 122.00 l
% shower volume = 49.50 l
% toilet volume = 6.22 l
% washing machine energy = 172.08 l
% shower energy = 72.62 l
% toilet energy = 5.07 l

    % These figures are based on average duration and flow rates as found in \cite{Heinrich2008}, and the estimated head loss from Fig.~\ref{fig:headloss}.
    Over an average week the reference water meter would dissipate approximately \SI{7.20}{\kilo\joule} of energy; averaging \SI{1.03}{\kilo\joule} per day.
