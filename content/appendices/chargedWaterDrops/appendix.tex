In 1867 William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) described an apparatus that
could generate electrostatic charge using drops of water (some of
which are shown in Figure \ref{Figure_Drawing_KelvinWaterDripper_OriginalDevice})
\cite{Thomson1867}.

\end{figure}
 This apparatus works by inducing charge onto drops of water before
they detached from the source of the drips. It is this apparatus that
forms the basis for the investigation of the of charged drops of water
to generate useful amount of power.


\section{How charge is generated}

generator.}
\label{Figure_Drawing_KelvinWaterDripper_ChargingMechanism}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{Figure_Drawing_KelvinWaterDripper_ChargingMechanism}
shows one of the charge generating mechanisms of Lord Kelvin's electrostatic
generator. This mechanism is comprised of three main components, a
jet of water that breaks to form droplets of water, an inductor surrounding
the point at which the stream of water breaks and a receiver where
the charged water droplets are condensed.

A simplified diagram of the apparatus is shown in Figure \ref{Fig_Diagram_KelvinWaterDripper}
and will be used to explain the concept further.

The diagram illustrates the charge of each element by its colour.
Equal and opposite amounts of electrical charge are accumulated in
each of the containers at the bottom. These containers are insulated
from one another but are connected to the rings (near the droppers)
of the opposite side. The rings are responsible for inducing excess
charge on the drops (equivalent to the cylinder shaped inductor depicted
in Figure \ref{Figure_Drawing_KelvinWaterDripper_ChargingMechanism}),
which becomes trapped on the drop once it detaches from the dropper.
Once detached, the drops are pulled by gravity into the containers
below. Because the container below is charged with like charges there
is a repulsive force between the falling drop and the container. It
is this force acting over the distance through which the drop falls
that is responsible for doing work (forcing the drop onto a body that
has the same net polarity of as the drop) and thus increasing the
voltage of the container/ring.


\section{Replicating the experiment\label{sub:Replicating-the-experiment}}

The first step toward assessing the electrostatic generators ability
to generate energy for the water meter was to replicate the experiment.
This work was done by a Summer Research Scholarship student Jonathon
McMullen.


\section{Optimising output}

Once the experiment had been replicated, questions arose regarding
how to best optimise the design.


\subsection{Drop volume and frequency}

The first optimisation question in its most practical form was ``is
it better to have lots of small drops or less larger drops?''. To
answer this question a more simplified experiment was performed with
the help of another summer research student, Wayne Crump. The purpose
of this experiment was to remove as many variables from the electrostatic
generator experiment performed by Jonathan McMullen (see subsection
\ref{sub:Replicating-the-experiment}) in an attempt to isolate the
effect of varying drop size, induction voltage and flow rate, independently.


\subsubsection*{Experimental setup}

\par\end{centering}

\centering{}\protect\caption{\label{Photo_dripperExperiment_Setup}Photo of experimental setup
for charge on drip measurements.}
\end{figure}


A photo of the measurement setup can be seen in Figure \ref{Photo_dripperExperiment_Setup}.
For clarity, a diagram of the experimental setup is shown in Figure
\ref{ChargedDrips_Figure_Drawing_ExperimentalSetup}. As can be seen
in this diagram, drips are formed from the end of a syringe needle,
pass through the induction ring and land on a piece of tin foil before
running off into a catchment container. A closeup of the needle and
inductor is shown in Figure \ref{Photo_dripperExperiment_Inductor}.
The frequency of drips is determined acoustically by the use of the
microphone and the flow of water is set by the syringe pump (as shown
in Figure \ref{Photo_dripperExperiment_SyringePump}).

\begin{figure}[h]

\par\end{centering}

\protect\caption{\label{ChargedDrips_Figure_Drawing_ExperimentalSetup}Diagram of experimental
setup for charge on drip experiments.}
\end{figure}


The volume of each drip is calculate by dividing the flow rate by
the drip frequency. The charge on each drop of water was determined
by dividing the average current by the drip frequency. The size of
drips was determined largely by the size of needle used but was also
affected by the magnitude of the induction voltage placed on the ring.

Because the current being measured was so small (in the nano-amp range),
direct measurement with a multimeter was not possible. Instead the
multimeter (a Fluke series 115 handheld multimeter) was set to measure
voltage in the mV range. In this setting the multimeter has an internal
resistance of 10$\thinspace M\Omega$ (as measured with another multimeter)
over which the voltage was being measured. Ohms law states:

\begin{equation}
V=IR
\end{equation}
Where V is voltage, I is current and R is resistance. Rearranging
this equation and substituting in our resistance of 10$\thinspace M\Omega$
we get

\begin{equation}
I=\frac{V}{10\times10^{6}}
\end{equation}
Where V is the output of the multimeter and I is the current through
the multimeter, through which we assume all charge collected on the
tin foil will flow.

\subsubsection*{Results}

\end{figure}
Figure \ref{Graph_dripperExperiment_chargeVsVolume} shows the effect
that changing the volume of each drop has on the amount of charge
bound to that drop. The shape of this curve is similar to what one
gets when plotting the surface area of a sphere against the volume
of a sphere. This was expected to be the case since excess charge
will position itself evenly over the surface of the drop and hence
be proportional to its surface area. If the same data is plotted in
terms of charge per volume versus volume of a drip, as is shown in
Figure \ref{Figure_Graph_dripper_chargePerVolumeVsVolume}, it is
evident that smaller drop sizes equate to a higher charge per volume
of water ratio.

versus drop volume for a fixed induction voltage of 2.5$\: kV$.}


\end{figure}


Figure \ref{Figure_Graph_dripper_chargeVsVoltage} shows the results
of changing the induction voltage on the average charge carried per
drop. These results indicate that the charge induced on a drop is
proportional to the induction voltage. Variation in the measurement
data was due to differences in room temperature.

Figure \ref{Figure_Graph_dripper_currentVsFlow} shows the effect
of increasing the flow on the output current of the measurement setup,
which is relatively linear.

\subsubsection*{Conclusion \& discussion}

Increasing the output of the initial apparatus is possible by doing
any of the following things:
\begin{itemize}
\item Favour smaller drops at higher frequencies.
\item Increase the total flow of water through the apparatus.
\item Increase the induction voltage.
\end{itemize}
Increasing the total flow through the apparatus is difficult to achieve
as this soon has adverse effects on the formation of drops. This usually
leads to the formation of a stream of water from the needle, reducing
the output as the drips aren't forming within the inductor.

Favouring small drops or increasing the induction voltage both increase
the charge to mass ratio of individual drops. As this ratio increases
the movement of the drops becomes increasingly dominated by electrostatic
forces between the container and the drop. As this ratio increases
so to does the tendency for drops to diverge from the path dictated
by gravity. Eventually there comes a point where the drops no-longer
fall and instead create a stream that loops to the nearest point on
the induction ring. For this reason it is important that drop sizes
are kept consistent as to maintain a stable charge to mass ratio to
which the design can be optimised for.


\subsection{Scale}

Due to the size of the apparatus the fields generated had to be relatively
large, requiring equally large voltages before useful amounts of power
is generated. There are two problems with generating power at such
large voltages:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Large voltage differences try very hard to neutralise each other.
This means that the geometry and materials used may need to be modified
in order to reduce charge migrating over insulating barriers.
\item Stepping these voltages down to a useful level is challenging and
would be very inefficient. Electronic components and configurations
that would usually be used to change voltage levels no longer work.
\end{enumerate}
Scaling down the design would allow the device to generate its maximum
practical output at voltages that are easier to deal with.

\end{figure}


Figure \ref{Figure_Diagram_ChargedDrips_Figure_Diagram_Forces} shows
a simplified diagram of the two dominant forces acting upon a charged
drop as it falls towards a like charged plate from a grounded plane.
These two forces are given by the following equations:

\begin{equation}
F_{down}=mg
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
F_{up}=qE
\end{equation}


Where $m$ is the mass of the drop, $g$ is the acceleration due to
gravity, $q$ is the charge on the drop and $E$ is the electric field
strength.
