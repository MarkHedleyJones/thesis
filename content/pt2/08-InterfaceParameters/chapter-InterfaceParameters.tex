Details of components in the electrode-electrolyte interface model and methods of determining its parameters have now been discussed.
Each component in the model has parameters that describe its behaviour, each contributing to the overall response of the model.
Measurements discussed in the preceding chapter are now carried out on the electrodes and parameters fitted to the resulting data.
Model parameters will first be determined for various concentrations of phosphate buffered saline (PBS), then for comparison -- in a living sheep's spinal cavity.
This will determine whether in-fact a one-tenth concentration of PBS is a good substitute for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which it is commonly assumed to be.


\section{Phosphate Buffered Saline}
    Scott \& Single fitted parameters of their model to a one-tenth concentration (0.1X) of a standard solution of PBS \cite{Scott2014}.
    I measure and fit parameters not only to the one-tenth concentration of PBS but to a range of concentrations from 0.025X up to 1X.
    Doing this allows for fitting the variation in model parameters to the concentration of PBS.
    The result is a model that can be used to predict the impedance response of an electrode array in a wide range of solution concentrations.

    \subsection{Resistor Mesh}
        The two stimulus electrodes were driven at \SI{500}{\micro\ampere} at a frequency of \SI{10}{\kilo\hertz}.

    \subsection{Series Resistance And Constant Phase Element}
        Discuss equipment and settings used to make the measurements.

        \Cref{fig:pt2-graph_transimpedance_pbs} shows measurement results for each pair of non-stimulated pair of electrodes along with simulated results using the fitted parameters.

    \subsection{Faradaic Current}

        Faradaic processes at an electrode/electrolyte interface are modelled by the Butler-Volmer equation:

        \begin{equation}
        i_{net}=i_{o}\left\{ \frac{[O]_{(0,t)}}{[O]_{\infty}}e^{\frac{-\alpha_{c}nF\eta}{RT}}-\frac{[R]_{(0,t)}}{[R]_{\infty}}e^{\frac{(1-\alpha_{c})nF\eta}{RT}}\right\}
        \end{equation}


        where:

        \begin{tabular}{rl}
        $i_{net}$ & = net Faradaic current\tabularnewline
        $i_{o}$ & = current exchange density\tabularnewline
        $[O]_{(0,t)}$ & = concentration of oxidising species at electrode surface $(x=0)$\tabularnewline
        $[R]_{(0,t)}$ & = concentration of reducing species at the electrode surface\tabularnewline
        $[O]_{\infty}$ & = bulk concentration of oxidising species in electrolyte\tabularnewline
        $[R]_{\infty}$ & = bulk concentration of oxidising species in electrolyte\tabularnewline
        $\alpha_{c}$ & = cathodic transfer coefficient\tabularnewline
        $n$ & = number of moles of electrons per mole of reactant oxidised\tabularnewline
        F & = Faraday's constant $\approx96,485$\tabularnewline
        R & = the gas constant $\approx8.314$\tabularnewline
        T & = absolute temperature in Kelvin\tabularnewline
        $\eta$ & = electrode overpontential\tabularnewline
