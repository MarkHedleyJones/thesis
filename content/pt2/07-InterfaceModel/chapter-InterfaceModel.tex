\section{The Scott-Single Interface Model}
  In 2013, Jonathan Scott and Peter Single published a compact model of an implantable electrode array \cite{ScottSingle2013}.
  That model was developed as a means of simulating the impedance an implant device would see once implanted into a human spinal cavity.
  It is compact in the sense that it requires a minimum number of parameters to simulate the interface between a given electrolyte and an electrode.
  The entire model, from `wire in' to `wire out', is broken into two parts.
  The first part is the interface itself, in which the effects of the double layer and polar reorientation are encapsulated.
  In order to use the interface model
  The second part models the resistivity of the bulk of the electrolyte as measured between any pair of electrodes.
  This is necessary to replicate the resistances seen between electrodes and does not include any effects of the interface itself.
  The interface model and its accompanying resistive mesh was developed specifically to calculate the impedance between the electrodes of an eight electrode array, such as is used in spinal cord stimulation.

  \end{figure}

  \Cref{fig:StJudeOctrode_Labelled} is an illustration of the electrode array and the numbering scheme used to identify each electrode.
  Each electrode on this array is made from platinum and is separated by an insulating spacer.
  The array has eight platinum wires that run through the cable to each of the electrodes.
  This electrode was used through the remainder of this thesis and is the electrode used by Saluda in medical trials of their stimulators.

  The Scott-Single interface is modelled by the circuit shown in \cref{fig:pt2-interfaceSchematic}.
  Each of the components and their functions will be explained in the coming sections.
  It is important to realise that this model only represents a single interface between metal and electrolyte.
  By itself it is incapable of simulating any useful electrode/electrolyte system.
  For that, a minimum of two interfaces must be used - one as a cathode and one as an anode.
  Additionally, some model of the electrolyte resistivity needs to connect the two interfaces.

  \end{figure}

  \Cref{fig:pt2-simpleElectrodeElectrolyteModel} shows the smallest/simplest use of the interface model.
  This configuration represents two electrodes placed in an electrolyte solution.
  It allows simulation of impedance between those electrodes and can be connected to other electronic circuits.
  A model like this is only valid for a two electrode system.
  Because the electrode array in our application has eight electrodes, the model is more complex.
  In full, that model will have eight electrode interfaces and a resistor network connecting each interface.

  % Figure \cref{fig:pt2-interfaceSchematic_noMemristive} shows a simplified version of the interface model.
  % It is simplified in that it does not include the memristors of the original model.
  % A memristor is a relatively new type of electronic device which hasn't made it to consumer electronics yet.
  % It behaves like a resistor that alters it's resistance depending on the sum of current that it passes.
